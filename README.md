# TeXboard
I designed a mechanical keyboard from scratch for the scientists, mathematicians, and control theorists of the world. It has LaTeX bindings for math and greek.

This also works as generic keyboard matrix interpretation code. Writtenin C-arduino for the teensy 3.1/2

12/1/2018 havent quite worked out some bugs in Latex, and functions. Excuse: I have spent maybe 2 hours on software.
2/14/2018 adding support for MkII. Still need to work on FN/GRK/META function handling. many bugs, not enough time
